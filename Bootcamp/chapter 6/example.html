    <h1>Pterodactylus</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
        Pterodactylus (from Greek πτεροδάκτυλος, pterodaktulos, meaning "winged finger"[2]) is an extinct genus of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterosaur">pterosaurs</a>, whose members are commonly known as pterodactyls (/ˌtɛrəˈdæktɪlz/). It is thought to contain only a single species, Pterodactylus antiquus, which was the first pterosaur to be named and identified as a flying reptile. Fossil remains of Pterodactylus have primarily been found in the Solnhofen limestone of Bavaria, Germany, which dates back to the Late Jurassic period (early Tithonian stage), about 150.8 to 148.5 million years ago. More fragmentary remains of Pterodactylus have tentatively been identified from elsewhere in Europe, as well as in Africa.

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <hr>
    
    <p>
        Pterodactylus is known from over 30 fossil specimens, and though most belong to juveniles, many preserve complete skeletons.[17][23] Pterodactylus antiquus was a relatively small pterosaur, with an estimated adult wingspan of about 1.04 meters (3 ft 5 in), based on the only known adult specimen, which is represented by an isolated skull.[17] Other "species" were once thought to have been smaller.[22] However, these smaller specimens have been shown to represent juveniles of Pterodactylus, as well as its contemporary relatives including Ctenochasma, Germanodactylus, Aurorazhdarcho, Gnathosaurus, and hypothetically Aerodactylus if this genus is truly valid.

    <h2>Paleobiology</h2>

    <h3>Daily activity patterns</h3>

    <p>
        Comparisons between the scleral rings of Pterodactylus antiquus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been diurnal. This may also indicate niche partitioning with contemporary pterosaurs inferred to be nocturnal, such as Ctenochasma and Rhamphorhynchus.

    <h3>Diet</h3>

    <p>
        Based on the shape, size, and arrangement of its teeth, Pterodactylus has long been recognized as a carnivore specializing in small animals. A 2020 study of pterosaur tooth wear supported the hypothesis that Pterodactylus preyed mainly on invertebrates and had a generalist feeding strategy, indicated by a relatively high bite force.
